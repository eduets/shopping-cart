          This is not a real store. This website is a fake online shop built as
          a practice project using React, React Router, and data fetched from a
          third-party API. It was created as part of a personal assignment and
          does not sell any real products. All of the games featured here are
          fictional listings based on titles developed by FromSoftware, and are
          included solely for educational and demonstration purposes.
